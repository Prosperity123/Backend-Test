# Backend Project Test named//  nth_most_rarest_item(list,n)

# Description

Given a list of integers, create a function that returns the nth-rarest item. The function, should be called nth_most_rarest_item(list,n) and its signature should look like this nth_most_rarest_item(list,n); where list is the array of integers and n is the nth rarest term. For example in ([5,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,3,3,3,2,2,1,5], 2), if 2 is supplied as n, the answer is 2 as 2 is the 2nd rarest item.
